# Monster-shooter-Pygame-game
This is a 2D shooter game that I have developed using Pygame. In the game the player controls a character that can move up and down and shoot at enemies by pressing the space bar. The game features enemy spawing, collision detection, and a simple UI that displays health, score and current round. 


## Features

Player movement: Move the character up and down using the w and s keys

Shooting: Press the spacebar to shoot bullets

Enemy Generation: Waves of enemies will spawn at random intervals and move towards the player

Collision Detection: Bullets can hit enemies and the game ends if the enemies hit the player enough times to reduce their health to zero

Score Tracking: A score is tracked based on the number of eneies defeated

Health System: Player halth decreases when hit by an enemy

Round System: The game has a round system that increases the difficulty as the player progresses
